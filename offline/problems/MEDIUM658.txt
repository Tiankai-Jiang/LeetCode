658. Find K Closest Elements
Medium

Given a sorted array arr, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.
  Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
  Constraints:
1 <= k <= arr.length
1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 104
