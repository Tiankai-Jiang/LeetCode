Medium

In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)
Return the number of regions.
  Example 1:

Example 5:
Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]

  Note:
1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
