366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
Medium

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.
  Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
  Explanation:
1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
          1
         / 
        2          
  2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
          1          
  3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
          []         
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]], [[3,4,5],[2],[1]], etc, are also consider correct answers since per each level it doesn't matter the order on which elements are returned.
