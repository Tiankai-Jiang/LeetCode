333. Largest BST Subtree
Medium

Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.
Note:
A subtree must include all of its descendants.
Example:
Input: [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]

   10 
   / \ 
  5  15 
 / \   \ 
1   8   7

Output: 3
Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one.
             The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
